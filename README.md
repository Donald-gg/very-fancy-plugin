# Very-fancy-plugin
A plugin that makes it easy to see breed count of genesis fancy birds from opensea<br>
In future more functionality will be added like ranking of birds, etc, if there is demand for it

The extension works with brave browser too

### How does it work?
Visit fancybirds collection on opensea<br>
Find the bird whose breed count you want to know<br>
Middle mouse click on the bird image on the main page to see the breed count<br>
Note:- You do need to be signed in to fancybirds.io to see the actual breed count<br>

### Why is this not in chrome store and is it safe?
Chrome extension store requires developer account which is subscription based and since I don't charge anything for this app, it makes zero sense to have this plugin posted on chrome store.<br>
The app uses simple jquery functions that fetch the right address and redirect the user to it. You can look into the code if you're concerned.
