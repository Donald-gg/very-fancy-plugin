The extension works with brave browser too

### Why is this not in chrome store and is it safe?
Chrome extension store requires developer account which is subscription based and since I don't charge anything for this app, it makes zero sense to have this plugin posted on chrome store.<br>
The app uses simple jquery functions that fetch the right address and redirect the user to it. You can look into the code if you're concerned.
